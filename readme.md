## Setting up application

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Create env file.
- Add database info.
- Run 'composer update'
- Run migrations 'php artisan migrate'
- Add dummy data through tinker. Run 'php artisan tinker'.
